![Chords Default](public/assets/dark/HeroSignalsClean.png)


Chords is an application based on Web Serial connection, you can connect boards like Arduino Uno, Arduino Nano after uploading the ArduinoFirmware.ino code to it, you'll recieve data signals from the board which can be visualized on web using Chords. Users can visualize ECG and EMG signals.

> [!NOTE]
> Flash Arduino code to your hardware from [Chords Arduino Firmware](https://github.com/upsidedownlabs/Chords-Arduino-Firmware) to use it with Chords.

## Features

- **Connection**: Experience a smooth connection/disconnection with board in single click.
- **Real-time Visualization**: Visualize incoming data without any jitter from the board in real-time.
- **Recording**: Record the signals data and download data in csv file.

## How to use

1.  Connect the Arduino to your computer using a USB cable.
2.  Open the Arduino IDE and flash the provided firmware onto the Arduino.
3.  Open Chords in a web browser.
4.  Click the "Connect" button to establish a connection with the Arduino and stream.
5.  Click the "Zoom" button to zoom in on data visualization.
6.  Click the "Play/Pause" to control data flow and navigate frames with forward/backward buttons.
7.  Click the "Record" button to record data.
8.  Click the "download" button to download the recorded data.
9.  Click the "Delete" button to delete recorded data.
10. Click the "Plus/Minus" button to increase/decrease channel.
11. Click "Theme" button which is present in navbar to change theme.
12. Click the "Disconnect" button to terminate the connection with the Arduino and stop the data stream.

## Resources

- [Vendors](src/components/vendors.ts) list for board name and there vendor id are taken from [Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/typescript-web-serial?file=vendors.ts) created by [William Grasel](https://github.com/willgm)

## Roadmap for upcoming update

- [X] **Data Filtering** : We will be adding bio-potential signal filtering options which includes 50/60 Hz notch filter to remove AC interference noise and highpass/lowpass remove artefacts from ECG, Emg ,Eog and EEg. Under filters, we will be adding different highpass and lowpass filters for specific bio-potential signals this feature will further enhance the user experience to record even more clear biopotential signals.

- [X] **Frame Buffers of data** : We will add Frame Buffer Feature this option to show upto 5 snapshots of length each of 4 seconds, you can now view upto last five snapshots of your data and save them as images.

- [X] **Multiple file download support** : Weâ€™re excited to enhance your options for downloading recorded data! Currently, you can record a file and choose to save or delete it. Soon, youâ€™ll be able to download multiple files at once and have the flexibility to download or delete individual recorded files as needed.

- [X] **CSV compatibility with [Chords Python](https://github.com/upsidedownlabs/Chords-Python)** : we will update the CSV data format and file names for both chords-web and chords-python so that you can use csvplotter.py to easily plot the recorded data.
      
- [X] **Implemented Web-worker for Indexeddb** : We will implement web worker for IndexedDB operations, for better data visualization.
      
- [X] **Board Support**: Add support for the following boards
  - [X] **Arduino Uno R4 WiFi Support**: Add support for Arduino Uno R4 WiFi.
  - [X] **Giga R1 Support**: Add support for the Arduino Giga R1 board with its 16-bit ADC, offering a range of 0 to 65,535.
  - [X] **Raspberry Pi Pico Support**: Release Raspberry Pi Pico support for Chords. It works seamlessly with the new Heart BioAmp Candy. Share your favorite board in the comments, and we'll aim to include it in future updates.
  - [ ] **Arduino Nano Support** Add support for Nano board which supports up to 8 channels.

- [ ] **Improve Recording Functionality** : Resolve delays in updating the canvas count to ensure the downloaded file shows accurate values instantly. Ensure smooth recording performance for durations exceeding 5 minutes without any lag or errors.
