Chords is an application based on Web Serial connection, you can connect [Compatible Boards](https://github.com/upsidedownlabs/Chords-Arduino-Firmware) after uploading the ArduinoFirmware.ino code to it, you'll recieve data signals from the board which can be visualized on web using Chords. Users can visualize ECG and EMG signals.

> [!NOTE]
> Flash Arduino code to your hardware from [Chords Arduino Firmware](https://github.com/upsidedownlabs/Chords-Arduino-Firmware) to use it with Chords.

3.  Open Chords in a web browser.
4.  Click the "Visualize Now" button to navigate to the applications page, where you'll find three options: "Chords Visualizer", "Serial Wizard", and "FFT Plot".
5.  Select "Chords Visualizer" to connect with the Arduino and begin streaming data.
7.  Click the "Settings" icon to open the popover, where you'll find a "Zoom" slider to adjust the view as needed.
8.  Click the "Play/Pause" to control data flow and navigate frames with forward/backward buttons.
9.  Click the "Record" button to record data.
10. Click the "download" button to download the recorded data.
11. Click the "Delete" button to delete recorded data.
12. Click the "Settings" icon to select from up to 16 available channels. Use "Select All" to choose all channels at once, and "Reset" to revert to the previous selection.
13. Click "Filter" button for EMG, ECG, EOG and EEG filters with muscle, heart, eye and brain icons or master buttons for all channels. You can apply 50Hz or 60Hz filter to individual or all channel.
14. Click the "Disconnect" button to terminate the connection with the Arduino and stop the data stream.

## Roadmap for upcoming update

- [X] **Data Filtering** : We will be adding bio-potential signal filtering options which includes 50/60 Hz notch filter to remove AC interference noise and highpass/lowpass remove artefacts from ECG, Emg ,Eog and EEg. Under filters, we will be adding different highpass and lowpass filters for specific bio-potential signals this feature will further enhance the user experience to record even more clear biopotential signals.

- [X] **Frame Buffers of data** : We will add Frame Buffer Feature this option to show upto 5 snapshots of length each of 4 seconds, you can now view upto last five snapshots of your data and save them as images.

- **Enhance Recording Experience** : Improve reacording feature 
  - [X] **Multiple file download support** : We‚Äôre excited to enhance your options for downloading recorded data! Currently, you can record a file and choose to save or delete it. Soon, you‚Äôll be able to download multiple files at once and have the flexibility to download or delete individual recorded files as needed.
  - [ ] **Improve Recording Functionality** : Resolve delays in updating the canvas count to ensure the downloaded file shows accurate values instantly. Ensure smooth recording performance for durations exceeding 5 minutes without any lag or errors.


- [X] **CSV compatibility with [Chords Python](https://github.com/upsidedownlabs/Chords-Python)** : we will update the CSV data format and file names for both chords-web and chords-python so that you can use csvplotter.py to easily plot the recorded data.
      
- [X] **Implemented Web-worker for Indexeddb** : We will implement web worker for IndexedDB operations, for better data visualization.
      
-  **Board Support**: Add support for the following boards
    - [X] **Arduino Uno R4 WiFi Support**: Add support for Arduino Uno R4 WiFi.
    - [X] **Giga R1 Support**: Add support for the Arduino Giga R1 board with its 16-bit ADC, offering a range of 0 to 65,535.
    - [X] **Raspberry Pi Pico Support**: Release Raspberry Pi Pico support for Chords. It works seamlessly with the new Heart BioAmp Candy. Share your favorite board in the comments, and we'll aim to include it in future updates.
    - [X] **STM32G4 Core Board** This board has a 12-bit ADC and supports 16 channels at 500 sampling rate.
    - [X] **STM32F4 Black Pill** it features a 12-bit ADC supporting 10 channels at 500 sampling rate.
    - [X] **Arduino MEGA 2560 R3** Arduino Mega  features a 10-bit ADC and supports up to 16 channels at 250 sampling rate.
    - [X] **Arduino Nano Classic** Add support for Nano board which supports up to 8 channels at 250.


- **User Interface** : Improved user interface by following changes:
    - [X] **Channel Selection**: Display the available channels in a popover, showing a total of 16 channels. However, the number of enabled channels will be based on the connected board.
    - [X] **Zoom Slider**: Adjust zoom to focus on data points or view an overall plot.
    - [X] **Time-Base Slider**: Customize the time duration for displaying data per frame, with options ranging from 1 to 10 seconds.

- [X] **Serial Wizard** : We are introducing the Serial Plotter and Monitor, a powerful tool that enables you to visualize data graphically, display raw data in text format, and even use both modes simultaneously for a more comprehensive analysis. In the past,we had no better option to run both plotter and monitor at the same time and high-speed plotting that hindered real-time data visualization. To address these challenges, we've created a user-friendly, smooth-performing Serial Plotter & Monitor with multi-mode support, providing a more responsive and efficient data analysis experience.

- [X] **FFT Visualizer** :We've added FFT analysis and EEG band spectrum plotting to enhance real-time brain signal visualization. These features let you monitor EEG frequency bands‚ÄîDelta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma‚Äîfor deeper insights into mental states. The ‚ÄúFFT Visualizer‚Äù shows filtered EEG signals and offers two modes: Band Power for real-time EEG strength and Beta Candle, a unique focus-level indicator where a brighter candle means higher beta activity. You can also download EEG data as CSV for further analysis.
